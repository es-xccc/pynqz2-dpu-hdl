2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-46#1 Warning
Multicycle path with tied CE pins  
One or more multicycle paths are defined between registers pynqz2_dpu_i/dpu_eu_0/inst/g_e584eb07.u_822a997b/u_8329ce29/u_3aa346a2/u_dcd815c9/u_6c52c68e/u_870191c1/s_7c8ae0ce_reg/Q and pynqz2_dpu_i/dpu_eu_0/inst/g_e584eb07.u_822a997b/u_8329ce29/u_3aa346a2/u_dcd815c9/u_6c52c68e/u_870191c1/s_81ad3443_reg/D with a direct connection and the CE pins connected to VCC (see constraint position 9 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).  This may result in an inaccurate path requirement.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#1 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out_150M_pynqz2_dpu_clk_wiz_0_0 (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via set_false_path or set_clock_groups may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-47#2 Warning
False path or asynchronous clock group between synchronous clocks  
A False Path timing constraint is set between synchronous clocks clk_out_150M_pynqz2_dpu_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_fpga_0 (see constraint position 10 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). Masking entire synchronous clock domains via set_false_path or set_clock_groups may result in failure in hardware.
Related violations: <none>

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 1553 control sets (vs. available limit of 13300, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
